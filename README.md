# MoEmo Vision Transformer
MoEmo Vision Transformer is a new approach in HRI(human-robot interaction) because it uses cross-attention and movement vectors to enhance 3D pose estimation for **emotion detection**. Recent developments in HRI emphasize why robots need to understand human emotions. Most papers focus on facial expressions to recognize emotions, but we focus on human body movements, and consider context. Context is very important for emotions because the same pose with different contexts will show different emotions.
